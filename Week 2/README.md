# Xcode Playground

## Week 2 Assignment: XCode Playground

In this playground you wil be seeing for-in loops, arrays,  nested loops, functions, struct, and classes. 

### Assigment Requirements Completed

* Create an array of Int called nums with values 0 through 20. Iterate over the array and print the even numbers.
* In your Playground, define the following String: let sentence = “The qUIck bRown fOx jumpEd over the lAzy doG”Iterate over the sentence, counting the vowels (a, e, i, o, u), ignoring the case.
* Create two arrays of Int with the values of 0 through 4. Use a nested for loop to print a mini multiplication table. The output, which should be multiple lines, should be in the following format: 0 * 0 = 0 
* Write a function called average that takes an optional array of Int. If the array is not nil, calculate the average of the array's values and print: “The average of the values in the array is <average>.” Where <average> is the calculated average. If the array is nil, print: “The array is nil. Calculating the average is impossible.” 
* Create a struct called Person with the properties firstName, lastName, and age. Choose appropriate data types for the properties. Include a method on Person called details that prints the values stored in the properties in the following format: Name: <firstName> <lastName>, Age: <age> . Create an instance of Person called person. Pass your first name, last name, and age for the properties. Finally, call the method details.
* Create a class called Student with two properties: person of type Person and grades, an array of Int. The class must have a method called calculateAverageGrade that takes no parameters and returns a Double. Include a method called details that prints the values of the properties stored in Student along with the average grade in the following format: Name: <firstName> <lastName>, Age: <age>, GPA: <averagegrade>. Create an instance of Student named ‘student’ passing in your first name, last name, age, and an array of five numbers: 94, 99, 81, 100, 79. Next call the details method to output the details of the student.
