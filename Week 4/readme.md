## Week 4 Homework Assignment

In this XCode project you will be testing out a task application list in which would have these componets: forum, NavigationTitle, NavigationStack, NavigationView, @State, @Bindings, .sheet

### Assigment Requirements Completed

* A data model that represents a Task with the following properties: id of type UUID, title of type String, isCompleted of type Bool, and notes of type String.
* A Store that has an array of Tasks and operations to add and complete a Task.
* A ForEach loop, not a List, should be used to display the tasks.
* A Sheet will be displayed when the user taps the New Task button.
* Navigation will be implemented using NavigationStack.
* The app will use @State, @StateObject, @ObservedObject,@EnvironmentObject, and @Binding where appropriate for managing state and passing data.
* The app will have at least one ObservableObject with at least one property @Published.
* SFSymbols should be used in the task list and the New Task button.
* The app layout matches the layout in the video as closely as possible. There is no expectation that your layout exactly matches the layout in the video.
* When the Add button is tapped on the sheet for adding a new task, the new task should be saved to the Store, the sheet is dismissed, and the new task should appear in the task list.
* When the cancel button is tapped on the sheet for adding a new task, no data should be saved to the store, and the sheet is dismissed.
* When a task in the list is tapped, the user will be taken to the details page.
* The details page has a button at the top left that will take the user back to the task list.
* When the user taps the Completed toggle, the isCompleted property of the task is updated, and that update is reflected when the user returns to the task listâ€”a red empty square for false, a green check mark, and a square for true.
* The code is in multiple files, and Views should be extracted when it makes sense. See Episode 6, Extract View from Your First iOS & SwiftUI App: Polishing the App.
*When the app starts, there are at least 5 tasks in the list.
